# CAPSTONE PROJECT IDEAS


#### Project 1 - Food Image Recognition

The project aim is to train a system capable of recognizing food items in images and correctly classifying the images with the right type of food label.
As part of the work, I would hope to compare two or more machine learning algorithms and/or approaches to see what works best, and also learn the key parameters and how to tune them to maximize classification accuracy.

#### Project 2 - Credit Fraud Detection

This project would be focused on training a machine learning algorithm to predict possible fraudulent credit applications.
The idea would be to find the algorithm that gives the highest accuracy (according to some well defined metric), and to try different types of feature engineering on the data to see how this impacts the results.

#### Project 3 - Email Fraud Detection

In the project, I would seek to analyze a large set of emails in order to detect possible fraudulent activities, both by looking at email content (i.e., specific types of works, phrases etc.) as well as looking at email metadata (for example volume, timing, frequency of communication between two or more parties).
I would also explore different ways of visualizing the body of data.
