In the best case this led to an almost doubling of classifier accuracy.

#### Sticking with one set of features and comparing different algorithms

Sticking with the RGB Histogram as features, I tried comparing a number of different algorithms on the same training / testing data.

Overall the best result came from a Random Forest with 25% accuracy and F1 score of 0.241, followed by Polynomial SVC with accuracy 22% and F1 0.222.
The Random Forest was notably faster than the SVC with 7s training time compared to 2mins 4s for the SVC.

#### Feature extraction using different approaches

I decided to focus on Random Forest as a classifier due to its better accuracy in my comparison, and also due to its significantly faster training and testing time, and instead focus on generating different types of features.

For benchmarking I also included results of K-Nearest Neighbors for different feature sets. By this stage, a combination of RGB Histogram values chained with individual pixels gave the best result: accuracy 27%, F1 0.26.

25. **Segments as Features**

This approach is similar to using the sliding window as above, however instead of working with boxes of a fixed size, using segments identified for each image with the skimage SLIC algorithm (uses k-means clustering in Color-(x, y, z) space).

- **Features:** Splitting training images into segments and for each segment using Average, Max, Min, Range of Color values for RGB, + normed histograms for RGB
